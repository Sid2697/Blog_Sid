This article summarises my progess in GSoC over weeks twelve and thirteen of the GSoC coding period.

Using Django, I created an API that anyone can use on their webpage for using the pipeline developed during the GSoC coding period. Furthermore, I udpated the documentation of the code written making it easy to follow and utilise.

The following link contains all the code written during the GSoC period along with the API and documentation: [GitHub](https://github.com/dbpedia/image-search-gsoc-2022/).
