This article summarises my progess in GSoC over weeks ten and eleven of the GSoC coding period.

For these weeks, I went on to further update the UI of the web interface created. Instead of giving the image index as an input, I added an upload button to the webpage. Now, the user can upload any image to the portal. The input image will then be processed to generate its embedding and the embedding generated is used to query the pre-saved dataset.

Here is the link to the code for creating the webpage: [GitHub](https://github.com/dbpedia/image-search-gsoc-2022/tree/main/website_demo).
