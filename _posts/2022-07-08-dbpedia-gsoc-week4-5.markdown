This article summarises my progess in GSoC over weeks five and six of the GSoC coding period.

For these weeks, I got permission from my mentors to visit New Orleans for attending [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/) conference. Here, along with other authors, I presented my work [Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Videos](https://ego4d-data.org/).
