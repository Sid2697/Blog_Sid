I am a Research Fellow at [CVIT Lab, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in). I am working under [Dr C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) on creating an OCR (Optical Character Reader) for Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu). I also work as Dr Jawahar's Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course 'Statistical Methods for Artificial Intelligence'. I am broadly interested in 2D and 3D Computer Vision, Deep Learning and related problems.

This is a series of blog posts for gathering notes on interesting concepts read by me. These blog posts aim to provide readers with a solid idea on the topic they are reading. Topics range from various algorithms to research papers and stuff I care about.
